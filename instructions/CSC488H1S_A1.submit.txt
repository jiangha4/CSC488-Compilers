What to submit / How to submit Assignment 1

1) Submit  tar ball named  csc488h.A1.XY.tar  (where XY is your team number).
   If more than one tar ball is submitted by a team we will use the most
   recent one.  Like this:

   submit -c csc488h  csc488h.A1.XY.tar

   See "man submit" on CDF for more information.

The tar ball should contain:

a) A README.A1 file that describes what each team member did for this assignment

b) The README.A1 file should also contain a *brief* (i.e. 1 .. 2 sentences) 
   description of each of your programs.  The author(s) of each program
   should also be identified in each program file.

c) The five programs called for in the assignment.
   To facilitate processing and marking of Assignment 1, all teams *must*
   use the file name conventions:

        A1a.488
        A1b.488
        A1c.488
        A1d.488
        A1e.488

NOTE: these file names and the name of the tarball itself are
*case sensitive*.  Please try to hard to get the names exactly
right so you don't break our automated processing scripts.

2) You do not have to submit any hardcopy for this assignment.

3) We strongly suggest that each team adopt a common "coding style"
   i.e. how a program is formatted, comment and indentation conventions.
  The particular style used by a team is not important but consistency among
  different program is. A consistent style will help team members 
  read each others programs and it will make it easier for the TA to mark 
  your software.
