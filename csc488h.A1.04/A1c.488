% Various ways of counting to 10
begin
    % Integer Declaration
    integer a

    % Infinite loop, explicit exit, but really it's a finite loop
    a <= 1
    loop
        put a, " "
        if a = 10 then
            exit
        end
        a <= a + 1
    end
    put skip

    % Actually an infinite loop.
    a <= 1
    loop 
        put "a = ", a, skip
    end

    % Infinite loop, 'exit when'
    a <= 1
    loop
        put a, " "
        exit when a = 10
        a <= a + 1
    end
    put skip

    % Conditional loop
    a <= 1
    while a <= 10 do
        put a, " "
        a <= a + 1
    end

    % While-do with exit
    a <= 1
    while true do
        put "a = ", a, skip
        exit
    end

    % While-Do with exit condition
    a <= 1
    while true do 
        put "a = ", a, skip
        exit when a = 10
        a <= a + 1
