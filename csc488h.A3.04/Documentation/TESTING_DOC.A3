Testing
-------
How to run all tests: 

> python3 runtestrunner.py

Tests' folder structure:
All tests can be found under the tests/passing and tests/failing folders. 

Our strategy was to develop as many tests as we could think of and let the tests aid
us in identifying and correcting errors in our code. We wanted to create 
both basic and convoluted semantic tests. This would ensure that our semantic check
was correct and that we did not overlook small details during the design and 
implemention of the semantic check. Infact, our testing cases helped tremendously in 
finding errors in the semantic check. 

Below is an overview of the tests from each folder:

tests/passing:
Tests contained in the passing directory are all syntactically and semantically valid.

declarations:
In this folder are tests for all declarations of functions, procedures, arrays,
and variables. Both functions and procedures have tests for declarations with
and without parameters and bodies. For arrays, both one dimensional and two 
dimensional array declarations were tested along with different integer bounds. 
Different types of variable declarations were tested such as multi and single
declarations of different types. 

expressionTypeChecking:
As the name suggests, this folder contains tests for expression type checking. As
there are many semantic rules involved with type checking, this folder is further
divided into which semantic rules are being tested. 

    S30: This directory contains tests to ensure that expressions in 'while' and 
    'exit when' statements were boolean values. All expressions involving comparions 
    such as '&' and '|' were also checked. A mixture of true and false values were
    used along with ensuring that boolean variables were type checked correctly. 

    S31: This directory contains tests to ensure an integer type. Array bounds, 
    mathematical expressions, and mathematical comparisons were all tested. 

    S32: This directory contains tests to ensure that left and right operands
    of expression were the same type. We tested both boolean and integer values
    and variables with equal and not equal expressions. 

    S34: This directory contains tests to ensure that variable and expression 
    assignments were the same type. We tested assignment of variables to both
    values and to other variables. 

    S35: This directory contains tests to ensure that the expression type matches
    the return type of the enclosing function. We tested both boolean and integer
    functions returning values and arrays. 

    S36: This directory contains tests to ensure that the type of the arguments
    match the type of the formal parameter. We have tests for both functions and 
    procedures with strictly boolean  parameters, strictly integer parameters, 
    and mixed parameters.

    S37, S38: These two directories contain tests to ensure that a identifier 
    has been properly declared as a scalar or array variable. Tests include both
    boolean and integer variables. 

functionsProceduresAndArgs:
This directory contains tests for semantic rules 40-43.

    S40, S41: These directories contains tests for checking if an identifier
    has been declared as a function or procedure. It includes tests of function
    and procedure calls with and without parameters.

    S42, S43: These directories contains test for checking to ensure that functions
    and procedures are called with the correct amount of arguments. S42 contains
    tests that test function and procedures declared without arguments while
    S43 contains tests that test functions and procedures delcared with arguments.

scope:
This directory contains tests for scoping. We tested empty scope, function and 
procedure scopes with and without parameters, nested scopes, and scopes with 
declarations. 

statementChecking:
This directory contains tests for testing correctess conditions for statements.

    S50: This directory contains tests to ensure that a exit statement is 
    inside of a loop. It contains tests with 'loop' and 'while' statements in
    both major and minor scopes, nested loops, and conditional 'exit' statements. 

    S51, S52: These two directories contain tests to ensure that a return is inside
    a function or a procedure. We tested declared and anonymous functions and 
    procedures in major, minor, and nested scopes. 

    S53: This directory contains testes to ensure that a function body contains
    at least one return statement. We tested declared functions with and without 
    parameters for multiple and singlar return statements, along with condition 
    'if' statement returns and nested returns. 

tests/failing
Tests contained in the failing directory are all syntactically valid, but are not
semantically valid. 

declarations: 

    S46: We created tests that had lower bounds greater than the upper bounds.

expressionTypeChecking:
    
    S30: We created tests that had integers and integer variables as boolean
    expression checks in both 'loop' and 'while' constructs. We also created
    invalid logical comparisons. 

    S31: We created tests that had boolean values in mathematical expressions.

    S32: We created tests that had different types on the left and right
    hand side of '=' and '!=". 

    S34: We created tests that had faulty assignment statements such as assigning
    a boolean constant to an integer and vice versa. 

    S35: We created tests that had faulty return values where the return types did 
    not match the function type.

    S36: We created tests that had faulty function and procdeure calls in where the
    argument types did not match the declared argument types.

    S37-S38: We created tests that assigned both boolean and integer values to 
    undeclared variables. We created tests that tested these in different 
    statements such as in gets, exits, function calls, procdure calls, loops, returns,
    arrays, puts. 

    S39: We created tests that had undeclared parameters being used in different
    statements such as in gets, exits, function calls, procdure calls, loops, returns,
    arrays, puts. 

    
functionsProceduresAndArgs:
    S40, S41: We created tests that had incorrect declarations such as calling 
    a variable indentifier, calling undeclared functions and procedures, and 
    calling later declared functions and procedures.

    S42, S43: We created tests that had function and procedure calls that had
    the incorrect amount of arguments. 

statementChecking: 

    S50: We created tests that had faulty exit statements such as exit statements
    without loops, in functions, and in procedures.

    S51-S52: We created tests that had invalid return statements such as return 
    statments that was not in the scope of a function or procedure. 

    S53: We created invalid functions that did not have returns. Test functions 
    had were declared with both parameters and no parameter. Nested functions were 
    also written to ensure valid return checking.
